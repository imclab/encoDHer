0.3 - Oct. 16, 2013
 * keys.db is now encrypted with AES256 (passphrase supplied by user)
 * moved aam parser from rfc822 module to email module
 * --fetch-aam option now writes each encrypted message to a separate file
 * README.md and ANONYMOUS.md received significant updates
 * Updated encoDHer to use OpenSSL for key generation if M2Crypto is
   available. M2Crypto is a python wrapper library for OpenSSL. If M2Crypto
   is not available, encoDHer will use the old module from Mark Loiseau
   (renamed dh_pydhe and updated to use the same prime as in the distributed
   dhparams.pem file). A dhparams.pem file is now distributed with encoDHer
   that contains an 8192 bit prime using a generator of 5. Such a big prime
   is overkill for generating an AES256 encryption key, but what the heck...
   Unfortunately, old keys.db databases are not compatible with this upgrade
   and will need to be regenerated.
 * If the dhparams.pem file is absent, encoDHer will use the Loiseau module
   (renamed dh_legacy) with the original 6144-bit RFC3526 prime.  This is
   backwards-compatible with old keys.db databases, but will NOT be
   compatible with databases using the dh_m2crypto or dh_pydhe modules.

0.2 - Oct. 8, 2013
 * encoDHer now decrypts unicode strings properly
 * Invalid public key exception during a.a.m search is now handled
   gracefully (this might happen e.g. when you have created a new
   route, but not yet imported the destination public key)
 * s2k hash has been changed to sha256
 * --list-keys changed to --list-routes
 * added encodher DH and GPG public keys
